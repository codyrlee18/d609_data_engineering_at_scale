# d609_data_engineering_at_scale

### Project Summary

In this project, I ingested sensor and customer data from the STEDI Step Trainer system into AWS using S3 and AWS Glue. I cleaned, joined, and transformed the data through multiple trusted and curated zones, ensuring that only records with proper research consent were included. The final curated datasets were prepared in a data lakehouse architecture, enabling Data Scientists to use them for training machine learning models.

- All of the DDL scripts for the tables I manually created in Glue Console from the JSON Data are in the "DDL Scripts" folder. 
- All of the python scripts generated from the Glue Jobs I created through nodes in AWS Glue Studio are in the "Glue Jobs Scripts" folder. 
- All screenshots demonstrating correct row counts for each of the tables created and adherence to the project suggestions are in the “Screenshots of Athena Queries” folder.
